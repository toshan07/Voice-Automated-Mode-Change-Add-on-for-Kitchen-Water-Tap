# Voice-Automated-Mode-Change-Add-on-for-Kitchen-Water-Tap
This project was developed as part of the Design Practicum course at my institute. The problem statement required creating a mode-changing add-on for a kitchen water tap. Given that similar solutions existed with limited automation, I focused on enhancing automation in our design. I led the development of a voice-activated mode-changing add-on, controllable via user voice commands.

We utilized a voice sensor, trained on specific voice commands, to control the functionality of a servo motor. The motor would adjust the mode-changing button based on the given commands. This innovative product fills a gap in the market as no similar voice-automated solutions were available.
